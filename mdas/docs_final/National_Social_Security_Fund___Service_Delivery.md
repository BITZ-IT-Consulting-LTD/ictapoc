## Executive Summary
The National Social Security Fund (NSSF) is a statutory public institution in Kenya mandated to provide social security protection to all workers, encompassing both the formal and informal sectors. Established initially as a Provident Fund in 1965, NSSF transitioned into a Pension Scheme in 2014 following the enactment of the NSSF Act, No. 45 of 2013. Its core purpose is to guarantee basic compensation in cases of permanent disability, provide assistance to needy dependents in the event of death, and offer a monthly life pension upon retirement. Beyond these direct benefits, NSSF also mobilizes domestic savings, aids in poverty reduction, fosters financial inclusion, and helps decrease the national dependency ratio.

## Future State Process (TO-BE)
### Narrative
The To-Be process leverages the Government Service Bus to integrate with BRS (Business Registry) and the Payment Gateway. Manual data entry and document uploads are replaced by real-time API validations, enabling a paperless, cashless, and presence-less service experience.

### Optimized Steps (Digital)
| Step | Actor | Action | System |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Applicant | Applicant logs in via Single Sign-On (SSO) and selects the service. | Citizen Portal / SSO |
| 2 | System | Applicant enters Business Registration Number; System auto-populates details from BRS (Business Registry) via the Service Bus. | Service Bus / Registry API |
| 3 | System | System performs auto-validation of compliance (e.g., KRA Tax Status) via Inter-Agency APIs. | Service Bus / Compliance Engine |
| 4 | Applicant | Applicant pays fees via the Government Payment Gateway; System auto-receipts. | Payment Gateway |
| 5 | System | Application is processed by the Rules Engine. (Low-risk cases are Auto-Approved). | Workflow Engine |
| 6 | Officer | Complex cases are routed to the Officer Workbench for digital review and approval. | Officer Workbench |
| 7 | System | System generates a Verifiable Digital Certificate (QR Code) and notifies the applicant. | Output Generator |
