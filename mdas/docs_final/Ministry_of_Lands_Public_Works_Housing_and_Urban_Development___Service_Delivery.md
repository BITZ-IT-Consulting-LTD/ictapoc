## Future State Process (TO-BE)
### Narrative
The To-Be process leverages the Government Service Bus to integrate with BRS (Business Registry) and the Payment Gateway. Manual data entry and document uploads are replaced by real-time API validations, enabling a paperless, cashless, and presence-less service experience.

### Optimized Steps (Digital)
| Step | Actor | Action | System |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Applicant | Applicant logs in via Single Sign-On (SSO) and selects the service. | Citizen Portal / SSO |
| 2 | System | Applicant enters Business Registration Number; System auto-populates details from BRS (Business Registry) via the Service Bus. | Service Bus / Registry API |
| 3 | System | System performs auto-validation of compliance (e.g., KRA Tax Status) via Inter-Agency APIs. | Service Bus / Compliance Engine |
| 4 | Applicant | Applicant pays fees via the Government Payment Gateway; System auto-receipts. | Payment Gateway |
| 5 | System | Application is processed by the Rules Engine. (Low-risk cases are Auto-Approved). | Workflow Engine |
| 6 | Officer | Complex cases are routed to the Officer Workbench for digital review and approval. | Officer Workbench |
| 7 | System | System generates a Verifiable Digital Certificate (QR Code) and notifies the applicant. | Output Generator |
